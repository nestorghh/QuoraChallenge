# QuoraChallenge
take-home challenge

Suppose you are a Data Scientist on the Mobile team at Quora. The team has just introduced a new
UI design to the Quora app. The goal of the new design is to increase user engagement (measured
by minutes spent on site). The team ran an A/B test to evaluate the change. Using the data, help
the team understand the impact of the UI change better.
